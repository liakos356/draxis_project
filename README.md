This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Initialization of the project

1. Clone the project
2. In the project directory, you must first run:

### `npm install`

This will install all the necessary modules of the project

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
